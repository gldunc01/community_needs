If you can't tell, this is a passion project for me. By taking community level deidentified data gathered from a technology platform called Unite US, I am able to analyze the needs of the community. I will use this baseline descriptive analysis to edge closer to forecasting, and predictive analysis and then on to prescriptive analysis. This project is the descriptive leg of the analysis, where we understand what needs are present in the community. The end goal for the remaining legs of the project are to predict the needs of the community at certain times of the year. This will allow us to better allocate, and time, funding given to organizations that serve those needs within the community.

## **Getting the Program to Run**
<br/>

1. Make sure to have a version of python3 installed on your computer, visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python for your machine.
2. After you have downloaded python, clone the repository(repo) from github.
2. Once the repo has been cloned, go to your command terminal, navigate to the directory where you stored the repo and from within that directory pip install the requirements.txt file. This will make sure you have the necessary packages to run the program.
4. Now that you have installed the packages, open your IDE (I use VSCode), open the repo folder and run the needs_assessment.py program.
<br/>
<br/>

### Alternatively, you can run the program using **jupyter notebooks**, follow the steps below:
<br/>

1. Clone the repo from github.
2. Once you have cloned the repo, use File Explorer to navigate to the directory folder that contains the repo.
3. Once you have navigated to the folder, from the file path line type "cmd" to bring up the command prompt in that directory.
4. From the command line, run "jupyter notebook", this will open a browser window.
5. From the browser window open "needs_assessment.ipynb", run this to run the program.

## **Requirements Met**
<br/>

This project incorporates the following Code Louisville requirements:
1. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
2. Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to clean the data.
3. Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data. I also created some calculations with Pandas.
4. Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library.
5. Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code.

The final plots show what the top needs are in the community for June 2022 and what the gender breakdown is for the clients served. From these plots we see that Transportation and Housing were the top 2 needs of the clients and that the majority of those clients were female.
