If you can't tell, this is a passion project for me. By taking community level deidentified data gathered from a technology platform called Unite US, I am able to analyze the needs of the community. I will use this baseline descriptive analysis to edge closer to forecasting, and predictive analysis and then on to prescriptive analysis. This project is the descriptive leg of the analysis, where we understand what needs are present in the community. The end goal for the remaining legs of the project are to predict the needs of the community at certain times of the year. This will allow us to better allocate, and time, funding given to organizations that serve those needs within the community.

## **Requirements Met**
<br/>

This project incorporates the following Code Louisville requirements:
1. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
2. Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to clean the data.
3. Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data. I also created some calculations with Pandas.
4. Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library.
5. Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code.

The final plots show what the top needs are in the community for June 2022 and what the gender breakdown is for the clients served. From these plots we see that Transportation and Housing were the top 2 needs of the clients and that the majority of those clients were female.
